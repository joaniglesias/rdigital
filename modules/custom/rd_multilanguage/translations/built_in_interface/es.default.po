"lowers the barrier to registration, which helps increase the user "
"base, and offers convenience and security to the users. Because OpenID "
"cannot guarantee a user is legitimate, email verification is still "
"necessary. When logging in, users are presented with the option of "
"entering their OpenID URL, which will look like "
"<em>myusername.openidprovider.com</em>. The site then communicates "
"with the OpenID server, asking it to verify the identity of the user. "
"If the user is logged into their OpenID server, the server "
